"""Per-run build-process lifecycle helpers.

``bakar build`` launches kas-container via ``subprocess.Popen`` with
``start_new_session=True``, so the kas-container process leads a new process
group. This module persists that PGID to a ``build.pid`` file in the run dir
so a separate ``bakar stop`` invocation can target the build precisely instead
of brute-forcing a ``pkill`` that risks hitting other workspaces' daemons.

Mirrors the procfs/PID-liveness pattern in :mod:`bakar.hashserv`: liveness via
``os.kill(pgid, 0)``, identity via a ``/proc/<pgid>/cmdline`` substring check.
